# Changelog

## [3.0.0] - 22 September 2022

- Added adversarial functionality for 2 separate teams/controllers. See example script `test_fuzzy_controllers.py` for 
  usage.

## [2.2.1] - 14 March 2022

- Added requirements for properties for instantiation of `FuzzyController` class including `name()`, `final_controller
  ()`, `actions()`, and `__init__()`.

## [2.2.0] - 27 September 2021

- Added mandatory getter-only property `ControllerBase.name` (used for plotting controller name)
- Added mandatory static method `ControllerBase.final_controller()` (used by organizers to instantiate your controller
  on competition day)

## [2.1.2] - 24 September 2021

- Added getter/setters for `Scenario.name` to improve type safety as the Scenario name field is used for plotting 
  in the graphics window


## [2.1.1] - 24 September 2021

- Removed type hinting of `ShipSprite` in `fuzzy_controller.SpaceShip` to make testing of the controller class 
  consistent and available in headless configurations (i.e. docker, CI/CD)


## [2.1.0] - 22 September 2021

- Implemented `fuzzy_asteroids.dashboard.Dashboard` class to group together sprites/text related to the ship control
  actions
- Added "full_dashboard" option to AsteroidGame settings keyword arguments, running without the dashboard can speed
  up the environment evaluation
- Updated window title to "2022" for the new competition
- Moved global font/color related settings to `fuzzy_asteroids.settings`, for better consistency 
- Updated dependency to `arcade==2.5.7`


## [2.0.0] - 8 September 2021

This update marks a major update to the Asteroid environment which implements multi-agent control of Spaceships. This
is the current working basis for the 2021-2022 FuzzyChallenge, good luck to all competitors!

`AsteroidGame`  class changes:
- `time_limit` is no longer specified at the environment level, now is scenario-specific, enabling larger more
  complex scenarios to last longer than shorter scenarios
- Removed `lives` as an environment level parameter, specified at the Scenario level via `ship_states`
- Keyboard inputs will be applied universally to all ships in a multi-ship `scenario`
- Ship-to-ship collisions have been enabled, don't bump into your teammates!
- Multi-ship control actions/lives have been built as separate dashboards when graphics are on

`Scenario` class changes:
- Can specify `ship_states` argument in constructor which enables multi-ship scenarios, the `ship_states` argument
  should be a `List[Dict[str, object]]` which can be unpacked by the `ShipSprite` constructor. Use the `ShipSprite`
  constructor as a blueprint for what can be defined in each dictionary entry
- Can specify a `timeout` argument for each Scenario
- Added `ships()` function which is called by the environment to generate starting Sprites at scenario start-up

`FuzzyAsteroidGame` class changes:
- Added optional `controller_timeout` argument to constructor to enable asynchronous dropout of controller calls
- Added optional `ignore_exceptions` argument to constructor to offer the ability to ignore exceptions for longer 
  training runs and data analysis.
- Added graphics components to communicate exceptions/timeouts.


## [1.2.2] - 9 April 2021

- Scenario and controller names can now be shown in the environment graphics

## [1.2.1] - 8 April 2021

- Default accuracy value changed to 0% not 100%
- Improved print statements for end of scenario to say what scenario was evaluated
- Resolved crash which would occur when turn_rate/thrust given to SpaceShip are NaN

## [1.2.0] - 5 April 2021

- Added `turn rate` + `thrust` control meters to the graphics and moved lives to center/bottom
- Added more evaluation metrics to the default score class (evaluation times and exception tracking)
- Changed the intrinsic type of the `fuzzy_asteroids.game.StoppingCondition` enum to string for better readability

## [1.1.9] - 1 April 2021

- Updated the `arcade` dependency to version 2.5.6, resolves some speed/memory issues.

## [1.1.8] - 30 March 2021

- Fixed the logic that v1.1.7 introduced which was incorrect, where the FuzzyAsteroids class
  would not call the controller


## [1.1.7] - 29 March 2021

- Resolved error where controller may be called when the game is over, causing crash because the ship controller
  is expecting objects to be there that aren't (ex. no asteroids)

## [1.1.6] - 15 March 2021

- Ship/Asteroid sprites `angle` property will now be capped to (-180.0, 180.0) to simplify calculations
  on the controller side
- Resolved issue with sign convention of starting angle of Asteroids, now should correctly match
  the global angle conventions
- Resolved error in Scenario where ``count_asteroids()`` only counted correctly for 
  asteroids of size=4. This affected the ``max_asteroids()`` calc used in the Score class
- Map class properly uses the global settings as the default

## [1.1.5] - 15 March 2021

- Scenario can be labeled now, example: ``Scenario(name="random_asteroids")``
- Resolved issue where the environment would skipp counting the last death as a death

## [1.1.4] - 09 March 2021

- Fixed trig calc in Asteroid starting velocity to match map coordinate system.

## [1.1.3] - 09 March 2021

- Enabled specification of starting position/angle/lives of the ShipSprite
- Enabled the tracking of lives within the ShipSprite, rather than in the Game environment
- Crash printouts now state crash time and position

## [1.1.2] - 08 March 2021

- Resolved error where the final ship crash is not printed
- Resolved crash in completion of game mode, where the StoppingCondition enum
  could not be converted to an int

## [1.1.1] - 10 February 2021

- Resolved error in AsteroidGame where game would end immediately due to while loop conditional
  not being properly updated for new StoppingCondition enum
- Added Exceptions for incorrect user Score/Scenario inputs to run()/start_new_game()

## [1.1.0] - 08 February 2021

- Added StopCondition enum to highlight the game completion reason
- Added "time_limit" setting to the environment settings dictionary
- Time limit stop condition included, added time tracking to the graphics window
- Score now tracks time and stopping condition
- Fixed error where the ship was given an extra life. 
- Added computational cost tracking (evaluation time) to FuzzyAsteroidsGame via ``track_compute_cost`` kwarg, off by default

## [1.0.0] - 15 January 2021

- First official release of the Fuzzy Asteroids Simulation Environment
